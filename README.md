**1.** Clone my repository by "git clone" command
***
**3.** My hash of last commit 2404923ea44384af1ea5a05f0586e6011c51e430,i used command - "git log"
***
**4.** Create new branch in site, and i add branch on my pc - "git pull". Git checkout newbranch to change branch
***
**5.** Changes not occur 
***
**7.** In my opinion, there was a conflict in these two files because two identical tapes were occupied. Solved this problem with the git merge main command in the new-branch.
